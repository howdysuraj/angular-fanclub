# Angular Fanclub

> A Club for Thoughtful & Curious Minds. The platform for developers who demand stability, performance, and best-in-class tooling.

## Overview

Angular Fanclub is a single-page marketing/community site built with Angular 21. It promotes the Angular framework and offers WhatsApp-based community entry points for Talent, Developers, and CTOs/Tech Leads. The site uses standalone components, SCSS with CSS variables for theming (light/dark), and Material Symbols for icons. Styling is primarily custom SCSS; Tailwind is included but component styles avoid Tailwind in favor of semantic class names and shared variables.

## Tech Stack

- Angular 21 (standalone components, signals, SSR with client hydration)
- Router (single route: default homepage)
- SCSS for styles; global CSS variables in styles.scss for light/dark
- Material Symbols Outlined (Google Fonts)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (postcss) – minimal use; components use SCSS
- Vitest for unit tests
- Express for SSR server
